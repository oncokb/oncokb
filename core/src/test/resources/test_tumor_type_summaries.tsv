PIK3CA	G106_R108del	Colorectal Cancer	PIK3CA, the catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase, is frequently mutated in a diverse range of cancers including breast, endometrial and cervical cancers.	The PIK3CA G106_R108del alteration is known to be oncogenic.	PIK3CA mutations occur in colorectal cancer and are coincident with RAS mutation in approximately two-thirds of cases. While the alpha-isoform selective PI(3)-kinase inhibitor alpelisib and the pan-AKT inhibitor capivasertib each in combination with the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA-mutant ER+/HER2- breast cancer, the clinical utility of these combinations in patients with PIK3CA G106_R108del altered colorectal cancer is unknown.
PIK3CA	G106_R108del	Melanoma	PIK3CA, the catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase, is frequently mutated in a diverse range of cancers including breast, endometrial and cervical cancers.	The PIK3CA G106_R108del alteration is known to be oncogenic.	Laboratory data suggest that cancer cells with the PIK3CA G106_R108del mutation may be sensitive to the PIK3CA mutant- and isoform-selective inhibitor RLY-2608. Additionally, while the alpha-isoform selective PI(3)-kinase inhibitor alpelisib, the pan-AKT kinase inhibitor capivasertib and the alpha-isoform selective PI(3)-kinase inhibitor inavolisib are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer with select PIK3CA mutations, the clinical utility of these agents in patients with PIK3CA G106_R108del altered melanoma is unknown.
PIK3CA	G106_R108del	Breast Cancer	PIK3CA, the catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase, is frequently mutated in a diverse range of cancers including breast, endometrial and cervical cancers.	The PIK3CA G106_R108del alteration is known to be oncogenic.	The alpha-isoform selective PI(3)-kinase inhibitor inavolisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib and the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA-mutant HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.
