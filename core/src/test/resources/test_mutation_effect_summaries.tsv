This mutation has been found in endometrial and stomach cancer (PMID: 24071849). Expression of this mutation in a colorectal cancer cell line demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased protein and pathway activation compared to wildtype (PMID: 25551293).
BRAF	R509Q	Likely Loss-of-function	We do not have a mutation effect description for BRAF R509Q, however, the mutation effect description for BRAF R509H is: The BRAF R509H mutation is located in the kinase domain in exon 13 of the protein. This mutation lies along the dimer interface of the protein. Expression of this mutation in 293H cells demonstrated that it is inactivating, as shown by decreased protein dimerization and decreased downstream cell signaling (PMID: 20179705).

## Table 9.3: Leading Sentences, mainly test unknown mutation but fall under umbrella terms(Truncating Mutations, Fusion)
### Truncating mutation in oncogene
BRAF	T100*	Unknown
### Truncating mutation in TSG
BRCA1	T100*	Likely Loss-of-function	The mutation effect description for truncating mutations in BRCA1 is: Truncating mutations in BRCA1 can lead to varying C-terminally truncated proteins that results in aberrant protein folding, contributing to loss of BRCA1 protein function. Human breast cancer cell lines that contain a truncating mutation in BRCA1 display elevated levels of aneuploidy and impaired DNA damage response. In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970). Mouse models of BRCA1 truncating mutations develop cancer, including mammary carcinomas, lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (PMID: 11358863, 12483515, 12947386).
### Truncating mutations in TSG that not curated
PPP2R2A	T100*	Unknown
### Truncating mutation in both
GATA3	T100*	Likely Loss-of-function	The mutation effect description for truncating mutations in GATA3 is: Truncating mutations in the GATA3 gene result in loss of GATA3 protein expression which while sufficient to enable tumor dedifferentiation and dissemination, is not associated with tumor development. This data indicates that GATA3 may not be a bona fide tumor suppressor, but rather comprises a crucial differentiation factor in cancer development (PMID: 18242514). Expression of truncating GATA3 mutations in breast cancer cell lines led to increased protein stability and impaired interaction with chromatin and DNA binding (PMID: 24758297, 26637396). Additionally, GATA3 truncating mutations in breast cancer resulted in reduced GATA3 transactivating activity with abnormalities in cellular invasiveness (PMID: 23426732), and displayed sensitivity to inhibitors of the histone methyltransferases G6A/GLP, upregulated in many cancer types (PMID: 27588951) .
### Truncating mutation in neither
GATA1	T100*	Unknown

### Fusions
ALK	Test-ALK fusion	Likely Gain-of-function	The mutation effect description for functional fusions in ALK is: Fusions of ALK are common and arise from chromosomal translocations that generally fuse the promotor and N-terminal portion of a partner gene with the C-terminal portion of ALK, including the kinase domain. ALK fusions are most common in lung cancer (PMID: 22235099). Various ALK fusions in which the promoter of the fusion partner drives expression of the ALK gene have been reported and biologically characterized, including EML4-ALK, (PMID: 17625570) and NPM-ALK (PMID: 8122112), which are activating and oncogenic. ALK fusions are generally sensitive to small molecule ALK inhibitors, though resistance is often accrued through missense mutations of the fusion protein (PMID:24675041).
