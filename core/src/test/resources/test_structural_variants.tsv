Germline mutations in ATM result in ataxia telangiectasia syndrome and are associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers.	This ATM deletion is a truncating alteration and is considered likely oncogenic.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring an ATM truncating mutation.
CDK8-CDK8		DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE		CDK8, an intracellular kinase, is amplified in various cancer types.	It is unknown whether a truncating mutation in CDK8 is oncogenic.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring a CDK8 truncating mutation.
BRCA2-CDC16		DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE	Likely Oncogenic	BRCA2, a tumor suppressor involved in the DNA damage response, is mutated in various cancer types.	This BRCA2 deletion is a truncating alteration and is considered likely oncogenic.	While the PARP inhibitors olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with BRCA2-mutant ovarian cancer (olaparib only in the germline setting), their clinical utility in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring the somatic BRCA2 truncating mutation is unknown.
AR-AR		DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE		AR (androgen receptor), a transcription factor, is most frequently altered in advanced or castration-resistant prostate cancer.	AR is considered an oncogene and truncating mutations in oncogenes are typically nonfunctional.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring an AR truncating mutation.
EGFR	KDD	DUPLICATION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE	Oncogenic	EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is altered by amplification, mutation and/or overexpression in various cancers, most frequently in lung and brain cancers.	The EGFR kinase domain duplication(KDD) alteration is known to be oncogenic.	The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib, afatinib and gefitinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with EGFR KDD positive non-small cell lung cancer have experienced clinical benefit following treatment with an EGFR TKI.
EGFR	KDD	DUPLICATION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	TRUE	Oncogenic	EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is altered by amplification, mutation and/or overexpression in various cancers, most frequently in lung and brain cancers.	The EGFR kinase domain duplication(KDD) alteration is known to be oncogenic.	The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib, afatinib and gefitinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with EGFR KDD positive non-small cell lung cancer have experienced clinical benefit following treatment with an EGFR TKI.
